dbInterrogator
==============

A collection of OSGi services (in limbo) that provide interrogation methods for common database
platforms.

What started life as a java alternative to MySQLDump soon evolved into a support
library for dbRecorder, a database versioning tool.

Over time I have been slowly adding support for other database platforms and so I
decided it was time to wrap up the individual libraries into something more
coherent, hence the umbrella project - dbInterrogator.
